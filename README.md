# Motion planning

Code developed while doing course assignments and projects for the motion planning problem of different robotic systems.

## 1. Manipulator

- We implemented the RRT algorithm for the 5-DOF [Lynxmotion](http://www.lynxmotion.com/c-130-al5d.aspx) manipulator. We only considered the first 4 joints (the last joint does not affect the end-effector position) so the planning was done in 4D space.
